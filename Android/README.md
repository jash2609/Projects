To use our app, you need to

- Download the APKs and install the app to your Android smartwatch and Android handheld device.

- Connect your Android wear with your Android phone to enable the heart rate plotting feature.

NOTE: You can also download our zip files and run from Android Studio. Make sure to choose API 22 for both your wear emulator and phone emulator. But you won't be able to measure the heart rate by the wearable sensor.

There is also a presentation in this directory, which gives a high-level summary of our app.

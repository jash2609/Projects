This directory contains the original dataset.
The original data source for this project is the “World Development Indicators,” published by the World 
Bank. The data file this project uses is WDI_decade3.csv. It is a CSV file available from the World Bank.
The file contains many variables that are used by the World Bank, and many academic researchers, to
analyze the causes of cross-country differences in per capita income, economic development, health,
and many other indicators.  

The data set contains many variables that can be used as explanatory variables, like population statistics,
income distribution. Unfortunately, not all this data is collected for all countries. Thus, lots of data is
missing and not at random – less developed countries have worse coverage. 
Further the original source was in the form of Panel Data, and the file was further modified, which takes
10 year averages of the variables.

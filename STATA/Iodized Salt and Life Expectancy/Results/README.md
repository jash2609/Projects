This directory contains the constructed results listed below: 
 
1. datasetSummary.txt: describing all the variables in our dataset that we constructed
2. regressionResults.txt: outputting regressionTables (not part of write-up but for reference 
purpose). Realized installing estout package, but was not sure if you would have it to recreate
the file if you wanted on your local desktop. So stuck to outputting traditional STATA output in
the form of a log file. 
3. poorCountry.png: Graph showing the relationship between life expectancy and consumption of
iodized salt for countries who’s GDP per capita is lower than $755. 
4. richCountry.png: Graph showing the relationship between life expectancy and consumption of
iodized salt for countries who’s GDP per capita is higher than $755. 
5. regressionOutput: All regression results directly outputted by Stata.
